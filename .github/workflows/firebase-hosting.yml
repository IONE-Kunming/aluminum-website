        # Error: "The caller does not have permission" (403) 
        #
        # OPTION 1: Deploy WITHOUT rules (Current - Works immediately)
        firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes,hosting --project gen-lang-client-0988357303 --non-interactive
        #
        # OPTION 2: Deploy WITH rules (Requires permission setup)
        # Uncomment the line below and comment out Option 1 above after granting permissions
        # The --force flag skips local rule validation checks but still requires API access
        # firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,hosting --project gen-lang-client-0988357303 --non-interactive --force
        #
        # To enable Option 2, see: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PERMISSIONS.md
        # Grant "Firebase Rules Admin" role to service account in Google Cloud Console
