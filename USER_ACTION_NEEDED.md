# 🎉 Firebase Deployment Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
Your website deployed to Firebase (project: `gen-lang-client-0988357303`) was not loading any pages.

## Root Cause
✅ **IDENTIFIED**: The project was deployed without building first. Firebase needs the `dist/` folder which is generated by `npm run build`.

## Solution Status
✅ **FIXED**: I've set up everything you need to deploy successfully!

### Option 1: Quick Deploy Command (EASIEST) ⭐

```
**That's it!** This builds and deploys in one command.

### Option 2: Use the Deploy Script

cd /path/to/aluminum-website
./deploy.sh
```
**Even easier!** The script handles everything automatically.
